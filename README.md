Expense Tracker Application Using MERN Stack

1. INTRODUCTION

In today’s fast-paced digital world, managing personal finances has become increasingly important. With the rise in daily expenses and the complexity of financial transactions, individuals often find it difficult to keep track of their spending habits. Traditional methods such as maintaining handwritten records or using spreadsheets are time-consuming, prone to errors, and lack automation.

To address these challenges, the development of an Expense Tracker Application using modern web technologies provides a reliable and efficient solution. This project aims to design and develop a full-stack web application that allows users to record, monitor, and analyze their daily expenses in a simple and organized manner.

The application is built using the MERN Stack, which consists of MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. These technologies enable the creation of a scalable, efficient, and user-friendly system.

The primary objective of this project is to provide users with a platform where they can:

Add and manage their expenses

Categorize spending

Track financial history

Analyze spending patterns

By leveraging modern web development tools, the application ensures real-time data handling, secure authentication, and an interactive user interface.

2. OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT
   

The main objectives of the Expense Tracker Application are as follows:

2.1 Primary Objectives

To develop a full-stack web application using the MERN stack

To enable users to record daily expenses efficiently

To provide a user-friendly interface for managing financial data

To ensure secure user authentication and data storage

2.2 Secondary Objectives

To categorize expenses (Food, Travel, Shopping, etc.)

To generate insights into spending habits

To allow users to update or delete expenses

To provide a responsive design for mobile and desktop users

3. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Managing personal finances manually is inefficient and prone to errors. Many individuals do not maintain proper records of their expenses, leading to poor financial planning and overspending.

The major problems include:

Lack of awareness of daily spending

Difficulty in tracking expenses over time

No proper categorization of expenses

Absence of real-time financial insights

This project aims to solve these problems by providing a digital platform that simplifies expense management and enhances financial awareness.

4. SCOPE OF THE PROJECT

The scope of the Expense Tracker Application includes:

4.1 Functional Scope

User registration and login

Adding new expenses

Viewing all expenses

Editing and deleting expenses

Categorizing expenses

Viewing total spending

4.2 Technical Scope

Frontend development using React.js

Backend development using Node.js and Express.js

Database management using MongoDB

RESTful API integration

4.3 Future Scope

Integration with bank APIs

AI-based expense prediction

Budget planning and alerts

Mobile application development

5. LITERATURE REVIEW

Several financial management systems and applications already exist, such as mobile apps and web-based tools. However, many of these systems are either too complex or require paid subscriptions.

Existing systems:

Spreadsheet-based tracking (manual)

Mobile apps with limited features

Paid financial tools

Limitations of existing systems:

Lack of customization

Data privacy concerns

Limited accessibility

The proposed system overcomes these limitations by providing a customizable, secure, and user-friendly solution using open-source technologies.

6. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

The application follows a three-tier architecture:

6.1 Presentation Layer (Frontend)

Built using React.js

Handles user interaction

Displays data dynamically

6.2 Application Layer (Backend)

Built using Node.js and Express.js

Processes user requests

Implements business logic

6.3 Data Layer (Database)

MongoDB database

Stores user and expense data

Architecture Flow:

User → React Frontend → Express API → MongoDB Database → Response to User
